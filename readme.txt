This project is designed and implemented by Chen (09030413), based on ideas and teaching experiences of Prof. Xia and Guo.

During the process of practice course teaching, a management system can largely improve the efficiency of teachers's work and assess their students more transparent, fair and impartial. The design of the Practical Course Teaching Management System uses B/S structure, JSP + JavaBean + SQL Server. Teachers can access the system server through browsers to manage classes, courses and students, to automatically assign enrolled students, to designate student jurors and team leaders, to arrange classroom seating, to record grades, to analyze abnormal data, to summarize data and to export grade reports. Unlike traditional curriculum assessments, the Practical Course Teaching Management System developed in this subject can not only support teachers in operation, but also support student jurors in participation. It has integrated functions, clear design, strong usability, practicality and extensibility.

Only Chinese version is available.
